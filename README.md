# Driver and Maid Review
This is a project which was done in the course CSE311 (Database management System).
#Project Description:
Hiring a maid or driver could soon get more complicated. The householder and car owner may
have to issue an appointment letter that clearly lists the terms and conditions of employment. So
we will going to make a review website for about it. Here the visitors can see the review and the
information of the drivers and maids and they can recruit them through the website. And the user
can give review about their maids and drivers. There will be an interface for users and driver and
maids. User can add details about them and user can particularly search for any driver and maids
by their name. There will be two different sections for maids and drivers for simple user
experience. And in the worker section the drivers and maids can add their basic information. For
using this website people first have to create their profile and then they can use it. Then they will
have to fill up every section of the information that required in the website then after creating the
website user will see a new page and there they will see two sections about driver and maids. For
driver user have to put the destination and search it. And for maids they have to put the area
where they wants the maids to work. And for worker they also need to log in and for creating the
website they need to fill up information sections. And then another window will appear. They have
to choose driver and maids section. And then they have to select their area where they want to
work. Basically this is how the website will work. And we donâ€™t know more about the project yet. If
it get select then will research furthermore. And hopefully will able to create a fine project
For making this website we will probably use htlm, css, php, sql.
